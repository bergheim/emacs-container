#+TITLE: jolo

Not exatcly like YOLO but close enough - program like it's 2026.

YOLO-mode devcontainers for vibe coding. Spin up isolated Emacs environments with AI agents, point them at a problem, walk away.

Alpine Linux container with Emacs, Claude/Gemini/Codex (all running with permissions skipped), language servers, browser automation, and the usual dev tools.

* Quick Start

#+begin_src bash
# Install
ln -s $(pwd)/jolo.py ~/.local/bin/jolo

# Start devcontainer in any git project
cd ~/myproject && jolo start

# Scaffold a new project
jolo create myapp

# Worktree with its own container
jolo tree feature-x

# Fire and forget — AI works in background
jolo tree feat -p "add OAuth login"

# Spawn 5 parallel agents on the same problem
jolo spawn 5 -p "implement the auth system"

# Jump into a running container (fzf picker)
jolo open

# Clean up orphaned/stopped containers
jolo prune
#+end_src

* Build

#+begin_src bash
podman build --build-arg USERNAME=$(whoami) \
             --build-arg USER_ID=$(id -u) \
             --build-arg GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
             -t emacs-gui .
#+end_src

* Layout

#+begin_example
Containerfile            # image definition
jolo.py                  # the CLI
container/               # scripts baked into the image
docs/                    # research notes
templates/               # scaffolds for new projects
#+end_example

* How It Works

Each ~jolo start~ invocation gets an isolated container with its own git worktree, port, shell history, and AI credentials. Agents run in detached tmux sessions — attach when you want, ignore when you don't.

~spawn~ mode fans out N worktrees with agents round-robining through Claude, Gemini, and Codex. Each gets a unique ~$PORT~ (4000, 4001, ...). Ports 4000-5000 are forwarded to the host.
