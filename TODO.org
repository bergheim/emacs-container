#+TITLE: Security Analysis for Autonomous Agent Execution
#+DESCRIPTION: Practical security assessment - what actually matters vs security theater

* Overview

This document analyzes security for running Claude Code in YOLO mode inside containers. The goal: *maximum usability while understanding real risks*.

Guiding principle: If removing access breaks the tool's usefulness, it's not a security improvement - it's just making the tool worse.

* Risk Assessment

** SAFE: GPG Agent Socket

*** Current State
Only the agent socket is mounted, not the private keys:
#+begin_src
pubring.kbx (readonly)    - public keys only
trustdb.gpg (readonly)    - trust database
S.gpg-agent socket        - communication with host agent
#+end_src

*** Status: Already Secure
Private keys *never enter the container*. Agent can request signatures but cannot extract key material. This is the correct design.

Signing commits as the user is *intended behavior* - the user is directing the work.

- [X] No action needed

** FIXED: Claude Configuration (~/.claude)

*** Current State
Selective mounts (readonly):
#+begin_src
~/.claude/.credentials.json (readonly) - auth tokens
~/.claude/settings.json (readonly)     - user preferences
~/.claude/statsig/ (readonly)          - feature flags (subscription, theme)
#+end_src

Excluded (cross-project isolation):
- =projects/= - per-project memory/instructions
- =history.jsonl= - global command history
- =todos/= - todo lists from other projects

*** Security Benefit
- No cross-project instruction injection
- No global history/memory leakage
- Feature flags work (subscription, theme)
- Auth just works (no setup needed)

- [X] Fixed - selective readonly mounts

** INHERENT: API Keys in Environment

*** Current State
#+begin_src
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY
#+end_src

*** Why This Can't Be "Fixed"
No key = no Claude. This is the service, not a container config issue.

- [X] Required for tool to function

** INHERENT: GitHub CLI Configuration

*** Current State
#+begin_src
source=${localEnv:HOME}/.config/gh (readonly)
#+end_src

*** Why This Is Needed
You want to use =gh= commands - that's why it's mounted. The agent doing =gh pr create= is the feature, not a bug.

Already readonly - agent can't modify the config.

- [X] Required for intended workflow

** INHERENT: Network Access

*** Current State
Full network access, ports 4000-5000 forwarded.

*** Why This Is Needed
- Git push/pull
- API calls to Claude
- Package installation (npm, pip, go get)
- Web dev servers

Disabling network makes the tool nearly useless.

- [X] Required for tool to function

** INHERENT: Git Configuration

*** Current State
#+begin_src
source=${localEnv:HOME}/.gitconfig (readonly)
#+end_src

*** Status: Already Secure
Readonly. Needed for git to work (name, email, signing key).

- [X] Already readonly, required for git

** INHERENT: Workspace Access

*** Current State
Full read/write to project directory.

*** This IS The Point
The entire purpose is editing code. Can't sandbox this without making the tool useless.

Review changes with =git diff= before committing - that's the workflow.

- [X] Required - this is the core function

** SAFE: Sudo with Known Password

*** Current State
#+begin_src dockerfile
ARG USER_PASSWORD=dev123
#+end_src

*** Why This Isn't A Real Risk
With rootless Podman: root inside container ≠ root on host.

You *want* sudo to work - installing packages, modifying system files in the container. Agent having sudo inside the container is fine.

- [X] Not a host security risk with rootless containers

** DONE: Shell History

*** Current State
=.histfile= persisted in =.devcontainer/= (per-project, gitignored).

- [X] Per-project history (no cross-contamination)
- [X] In .devcontainer/ which is gitignored

** FIXED: Emacs Configuration

*** Current State
- =start-emacs.sh= uses a sandbox (yadm worktree) - SAFE
- =yolo.py= mounts both config and cache readonly - SAFE

*** Status
- [X] Config mounted readonly
- [X] Cache mounted readonly
- Changes don't affect host

* Summary

| Resource          | Status   | Reason                                    |
|-------------------+----------+-------------------------------------------|
| GPG Socket        | SAFE     | Private keys never exposed                |
| ~/.claude         | FIXED    | Selective readonly (no projects/history)  |
| API Keys          | INHERENT | Required to use the service               |
| GitHub CLI        | INHERENT | You want gh commands to work              |
| Network           | INHERENT | Required for everything                   |
| Git Config        | SAFE     | Already readonly                          |
| Workspace         | INHERENT | This is the entire point                  |
| Sudo              | SAFE     | Rootless container, not a host risk       |
| Shell History     | DONE     | Per-project in .devcontainer/             |
| Emacs Config      | FIXED    | Config and cache both readonly            |

* Actual Recommendations

** For start-emacs.sh users
Already secure - uses sandbox for Emacs config.

** For yolo.py / devcontainer users
- [X] Current setup is secure for directed use
- [X] ~/.claude limited to credentials+settings (readonly)
- [X] ~/.config/emacs is readonly

** For truly unattended autonomous runs
This is a different threat model. If you're letting the agent run for hours unsupervised:
- Review all changes before pushing
- Consider running in a VM instead of container
- But honestly, if you don't trust it unsupervised, don't run it unsupervised

* What Would Actually Be Dangerous (that we're NOT doing)

For reference, things that would be real security problems:
- Mounting =~/.ssh= (private keys) - we don't do this
- Mounting =~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d= - we don't do this
- Mounting =~/.password-store= - we don't do this
- Running as root with =--privileged= - we don't do this
- Mounting host root filesystem - we don't do this

The current setup avoids actual dangerous patterns.
